## 4. About.
Open Sphere is an application used to visualize temporal/geospatial data. The application represents data using a three-dimensional model of the earth, and has the ability to handle large volumes of features and tiles. The core of the application is based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards.

OpenSphere was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with BIT Systems. The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the Apache license.
## 5. Pull Requests.
If you'd like to contribute to this project, please make a pull request. We'll review the pull request and discuss the changes. All pull request contributions to this project will be released under the Apache license.

Software source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by NGA staff is considered a "joint work" (see 17 USC § 101); it is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open source license.
