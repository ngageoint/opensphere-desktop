/**
 * A non-abstract generic collection type that can be used as a document element
 * for a collection of any GML types - Geometries, Topologies, Features ...
 * 
 * FeatureCollections may only contain Features. GeometryCollections may only
 * contain Geometrys. Bags are less constrained they must contain objects that
 * are substitutable for gml:_Object. This may mix several levels, including
 * Features, Definitions, Dictionaries, Geometries etc.
 * 
 * The content model would ideally be member 0..* members 0..1 member 0..* for
 * maximum flexibility in building a collection from both homogeneous and
 * distinct components: included "member" elements each contain a single Object
 * an included "members" element contains a set of Objects
 * 
 * However, this is non-deterministic, thus prohibited by XSD.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Java class for BagType complex type.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following schema fragment specifies the expected content contained within
 * this class.
