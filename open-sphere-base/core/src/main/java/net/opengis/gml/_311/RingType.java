/**
 * A Ring is used to represent a single connected component of a surface
 * boundary. It consists of a sequence of curves connected in a cycle (an object
 * whose boundary is empty). A Ring is structurally similar to a composite curve
 * in that the endPoint of each curve in the sequence is the startPoint of the
 * next curve in the Sequence. Since the sequence is circular, there is no
 * exception to this rule. Each ring, like all boundaries, is a cycle and each
 * ring is simple. NOTE: Even though each Ring is simple, the boundary need not
 * be simple. The easiest case of this is where one of the interior rings of a
 * surface is tangent to its exterior ring.
