Instructions to generate the JAXB classes from the state schema
---------------------------------------------------------------

Clone the state repo if you haven't already:
git clone https://github.com/ngageoint/opensphere-state-schema.git

Copy everything over:
cp -r <git-root>/opensphere-state-schema/src/main/* <git-root>/opensphere-desktop/open-sphere-base/core/src/main/resources/schemas/state/

I've had to make some edits to what is checked in to get XJC to work:
Edit bindings.xjb and change "../xsd/filter/1.0.0/filter.xsd" to "../xsd/state/1.0.0/filter-extended.xsd", and change the package names to our convention, i.e. _220 not v_2_2_0.  Alternatively you may be able to revert the changes to bindings.xjb
Edit filter-restriction.xsd and set minOccurs="2"
Edit state.xsd and add the StreamOptionsType type, and stream element back in

Run the following from <git-root>/opensphere-desktop/open-sphere-base/core/src/main/resources/schemas/state
xjc -extension -d ../../../java xsd/state/1.0.0/state.xsd -b xjb/bindings.xjb

Either revert net.opengis.ogc._100t.PropertyNameType or edit it to match the previous version in the history.
